# 💸 Solana PDA Crowdfunding DApp

This project demonstrates how to build a **decentralized crowdfunding system** on the **Solana blockchain** using the **Anchor framework**.  
Each campaign is represented by a **Program Derived Account (PDA)** that:

- ✅ Collects contributions from users  
- ✅ Stores raised funds securely  
- ✅ Allows the program (not users) to release funds to beneficiaries  

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

Raise money for a wide range of causes:

- 🏥 **Medical emergencies**
- 🚀 **Startup launches**
- ❤️ **Non-profits and charity causes**

---

## 🧠 Why PDAs?

This project showcases how **Program Derived Accounts (PDAs)** enable **permissionless** and **trustless** fund flow:

- No private key holder required  
- Program controls the funds  
- Ensures decentralized logic in smart contracts  

> PDAs are the **backbone of on-chain logic** in Solana DeFi applications.
