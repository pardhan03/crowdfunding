This project demonstrates how to build a decentralized crowdfunding system on the Solana blockchain using the Anchor framework. Each campaign is represented by a Program Derived Account (PDA) that:

Collects contributions from users

Stores raised funds securely

Allows the program (not users) to release funds to beneficiaries

Use cases include raising money for:

Medical emergencies

Startup launches

Non-profits and charity causes

It showcases how PDAs enable permissionless, trustless fund flow without a private key holder, making them the backbone of on-chain logic in Solana DeFi apps.
